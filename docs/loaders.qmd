To extract data from Inspect logs Hibayes applys a series of extractors to the loaded eval logs.

## Extractors

Extractors define how and what you would like to extract from Inspect logs. Here is an example default extractor which extracts the default Inspect fields:

```python
@extractor # <1>
def base_extractor() -> Extractor:
    """
    Extract basic metadata from evaluation samples.

    Returns:
        An Extractor function that extracts basic metadata.
    """

    def extract(sample: EvalSample, eval_log: EvalLog) -> Dict[str, Any]: # <2>
        """Extract basic metadata from a sample."""
        model_name_raw = eval_log.eval.model
        model_name = (
            model_name_raw.split("/")[-1] if "/" in model_name_raw else model_name_raw
        )

        # Normalize score
        score_value = next(iter(sample.scores.values())).value
        if score_value == "I":
            score = 0.0
        elif score_value == "C":
            score = 1.0
        else:
            score = float(score_value)

        # Record the log file path this sample came from
        log_path = eval_log.location

        return {
            "score": score,
            "target": str(sample.target),
            "model": model_name,
            "model_raw": model_name_raw,
            "dataset": eval_log.eval.dataset.name,
            "task": str(sample.id),
            "epoch": sample.epoch,
            "num_messages": len(sample.messages),
            "log_path": log_path,
        }

    return extract
```
1. **Registration** Each extractor is registered so that it can be accessed simply by specifying its name as a str. It also enforces an agreed upon interface.
2. **Interface** Each extractor takes the inspect log sample and log as an arg and returns a dic of values. Each sample yields 1 row in the hibayes dataframe.


## Defining your own extractor
It is common to need to extract bespoke information from Inspect logs. Here we define a custom extractor:

```python
from hibayes.load import Extractor, extractor

@extractor
def your_custom_extractor(
    keyword: str
):
    def extract(sample, eval_log):
        return {f"contains_{keyword}": if any(keyword in msg.content for msg in sample.messsages)}

    return extract

```

This can then be called in your config file:

```yaml
data_loader:
  paths:
    files_to_process:
      - path/to/logs
  extractors:
    path: path/to/above/python/file.py
    enabled:
      - base_extractor  # <1>
      - your_custom_extractor: {keyword: refuse} # <2>
```
1. calling the base extractor (this does not need the paths arg)
2. here we call our custom extractor and pass the required arg.
