## What is HiBayES?


HiBayES is a statistical analysis framework designed specifically for [Inspect AI](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai) evaluation logs. It implements the methodologies from our paper [HiBayES: A Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling Framework for AI Evaluation Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05602), providing researchers with robust tools to:

- **Extract insights** from complex AI evaluation data
- **Apply sophisticated** hierarchical Bayesian models
- **Communicate findings** through visualisations and tables

It is intended to be used once the individual has explored and understood the data and candidate statistical models have been proposed. HiBayES helps to productionise the evaluation plan for ease of use in repeated evaluations and ensures appropriate levels of reproducibility and audit.
